# Geekdots - now with chat!

Run this code and point all your buds to the URL, then take witness to the heart-pounding excitement of chatting!
Moving your mouse around also moves your dot, bubble and input box. Be the last of your geekbuds to sign in and your
z-index will rule them all.

Tested on Chrome. Not sure if it works in FF. Also, sorry about client.js ... I kind of butchered it :-P

Original code from @fjakobs. Thanks Fabian!
